# Changelog

**fable-orchestrator**, originally derived from [DannyMac180/fable-advisor](https://github.com/DannyMac180/fable-advisor) at its 3.1.0 and independently maintained since 2026-07-10 (detached from the fork network). Plugin updates are version-gated — every change ships with a version bump. Entries 3.1.1–3.5.0 below predate the rename, when this project was the fable-advisor fork; 3.5.0 was never published under that name.

## 1.11.0 — 2026-07-13

Adopted from field use (#6, #7, #8) plus live-probe findings about what the CLIs actually enforce.

- **The spec contract gains a sixth part: commit ownership** (#8). Lanes commit their own work on the current branch by default once verification passes — the wrapper records the starting HEAD before launch, commits as backstop if the CLI didn't, scopes the commit to the task's files, and both implementer reports gain a required `COMMIT:` field (hash, or an explicit "uncommitted — spec said caller commits"). A verified-but-uncommitted tree can no longer be returned silently as complete. Committing is not shipping: cold review runs on the committed ref, and the architect owns squash/merge at integration.
- **Cold reviewers take REFS, never diff files** (#6). A diff file in a shared directory can be clobbered by a concurrent lane between write and read — a clean review of the wrong bytes is indistinguishable from a real clean review. The codex-review lane now runs `codex exec review` (instructions name the target ref; the CLI derives the diff itself; `sandbox_mode` pinned read-only; `--json` makes LOG a machine-parseable event stream; verified end-to-end on planted bugs, including that instructions-mode scopes to the named commit — the subcommand's `--commit`/`--base` flags are mutually exclusive with custom instructions on codex-cli 0.144.1). The grok reviewer resolves the ref to a SHA and generates the diff directly inside its mktemp'd prompt assembly; both report the resolved ref as the review's identity.
- **Grok lane permissions rebuilt on what is actually enforced.** Live probes on grok 0.2.99 showed `--permission-mode acceptEdits` is parsed but not enforced (headless grok ran `git commit` and network `curl` under it) and `--sandbox read-only` did not block a CWD write on macOS — the README's old safety claim was imaginary. The implement lane now carries enforced `--deny` rules against the obvious forms of `sudo`/`git push`/`curl`/`wget` (documented honestly as a prefix-matched deny-list, not confinement), and the review and research lanes are restricted via enforced `--tools` allowlists with the MCP bridge tools disallowed (allowlists, because grok silently accepts unknown tool names — a denylist typo fails open, live-verified). `acceptEdits` stays for forward-compat only.
- **Narration-of-intent is a task failure by rule** (#7). Grok can run commands headlessly (the old "acceptEdits blocks commands" premise was wrong), so both implementer spec templates now demand pasted verification output — plus the commit hash under lane ownership — as completed actions, and a final message narrating future steps ("running X, then committing") with no captured output is claim-only BY RULE — the wrapper re-runs verification unconditionally.
- `run-lane.sh` rejects empty or non-regular-file specs loudly; smoke tests cover the new codex-review invocation, the grok deny rules, and the per-lane tool restrictions.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Codex fast mode**: a new optional CLAUDE.md line — `fable-orchestrator: codex fast mode = on` — opts both codex lanes (implementer and reviewer, in every lane mode) into the Codex CLI's fast service tier. Know the trade: ~1.5x output speed for ~2–2.5x credit burn (never cheaper), ChatGPT sign-in required (API-key auth can't use it). The architect forwards it as a `FAST MODE: on` spec line; the wrappers translate that into `LANE_CODEX_FAST=1`, which makes `run-lane.sh` add `-c service_tier=fast -c features.fast_mode=true` (smoke-tested: flags land only under the variable, grok lanes unaffected). Degrade is loud, never fatal: a fast launch that dies early is relaunched once at standard tier and the report carries a `FAST MODE: did not apply` line. `doctor.sh` reads the setting (project scope over user scope) and, when on, live-checks the fast tier — a fast-only failure is a warning with the ChatGPT-sign-in pointer, not a lane failure. Setup gains a fast-mode question (asked right after lane mode, off by default) with idempotent write rules; absence of the line means off.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-07-12

Adopted from field use (#4, #5).

- **Lane wrappers may never end their turn with the CLI alive** (#4, the dangerous mode): all five supervisor-using agents now run every `wait` slice as an explicit FOREGROUND command — backgrounding the wait and "waiting for a notification" is banned by name, because no notification re-wakes a finished agent while the detached CLI keeps editing, committing, or pushing an apparently-settled branch. If a wrapper's turn must end mid-run, it reaps first and reports `partial` honestly.
- **Reap evidence in the report**: `run-lane.sh reap` now confirms the process group is actually dead (`(group dead)` vs a loud `WARNING: group still alive` with exit 1), and both implementer reports gain a required `PROCESS:` field carrying that pasted output — a report without liveness evidence is visibly malformed. Smoke test asserts the confirmation. (Read-only lanes get the foreground rule but not the field: a surviving reviewer can't mutate the tree.)
- **Architect-side backstop** in the skill and README: a lane completion without a structured report is an error state, not a success — check `git status`/`git log`, `pgrep` for surviving lane processes, group-kill them, and re-run any verification performed while a detached process was alive. Checklist item 3 now points here (still seven items — an amendment, not growth).
- **Wrapper reuse bounded**: SendMessage continuation of a lane wrapper is for follow-ups on the same task only, never a long-lived pipe across many tasks — field data shows end-of-task discipline degrading past a couple hundred thousand transcript tokens while judgment still looks fine. Fresh wrapper per task.
- **Early-death retry legalized** (#4 mode A): a CLI that dies within the first minute leaving no diff gets one relaunch with the identical spec, noted in the report; a second early death reports `unavailable` with the evidence. The one-invocation rule states the exception.
- **Grok auth preflight retries once** (#5): a not-authenticated result from `grok models` can be a transient token-refresh race, so all three grok agents retry the check once after ~5s before failing the lane; only a persistent failure reports unavailable, with wording that no longer asserts ``run `grok login` `` as a certain diagnosis. CLI-not-installed stays an immediate no-retry fail. `doctor.sh` grants its grok live check the same single retry.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-07-11

- **`/fable-orchestrator:setup`**: interactive post-install wizard — detects installed CLIs and existing configuration, asks lane mode (grok/codex/mix, every option annotated with CLI status, none hidden), scope (user or project CLAUDE.md), and always-on; writes the two config lines idempotently (replaces an existing lane line in place, never duplicates the trigger, honest "no changes needed" on a no-op re-run); offers a doctor run at the end. Detect-and-warn only: it never installs CLIs, never touches settings.json, and writes to nothing but the one chosen CLAUDE.md.
- **Fable-gated always-on trigger**: the canonical trigger line (written by setup, documented in the README) now begins "When the session model is Fable" — sessions on other models skip the flow instead of running an architect pattern their model wasn't chosen for. Setup detects a pre-existing unconditional trigger and offers to upgrade it in place.
- **`/fable-orchestrator:doctor`**: slash-command wrapper for `scripts/doctor.sh` — plugin installs get lane validation without hunting down the script's cache path (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves it). The README points here first, and setup's skip note references it. The README's update instructions also moved into their own section.
- **README restructuring**: "Make it always-on" now shows only the gated trigger (the lane line was a duplicate of "Choose your implementation routing", which it now points to), and a new "Without always-on (per-task trigger)" subsection under "Use it" documents invoking the flow manually.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-11

Adopted from field use (#1).

- **Background by default**: new "Waiting on lanes" doctrine section — every lane runs in the background (the Agent tool's default; the doctrine bans forcing `run_in_background: false`), and the architect ends its turn on a one-line status and acts on the completion notification. A synchronous wait buys nothing (a blocked call generates no tokens, and a notification resume costs the same near-fully-cached context re-read) while holding the session hostage to the lane's wall clock — the user can't interject until the turn closes. Synchronous invocation stays available as the rare, announced exception for results that must compose in-turn. Surfaced in the README rules; the checklist stays frozen at seven (it indexes delegation steps, and this governs the wait, not the delegation).

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-11

Adopted from a fifth external Grok 4.5 review — all four items, one with a design choice.

- **Spike promotion gate** (the design choice: preferred over "security paths are never spikes"): spike status lasts only while the code is throwaway — spike code promoted toward main re-enters the review tiers as normal behavior-bearing work before merge. A hard ban would push legitimate auth prototyping back to informal undeclared downgrades; the gate bans nothing while closing the real leak path. Spike declarations on security/auth paths are flagged as a smell worth one explicit confirmation.
- **Checklist completed and frozen at seven items**: item 4 is now the full review-tier decision (spike/mechanical → verify only; behavior-bearing → opposite-family cold; security → add the silent-failure read), and a new item covers load-bearing research verification. The old item 4 actively contradicted the spike tier, not merely omitted it. Frozen: the checklist is an index, and further growth would turn it into a second dense body.
- **Spikes surfaced in the README** rules section, matching the skill.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-11

Partly adopted from a fourth external Grok 4.5 review.

- **Citation spot-check fixed**: reviewers now verify citations against the WORKING TREE, not "exists in the diff" — post-image line numbers usually don't appear as literals in unified diff text, so the old instruction false-flagged good citations.
- **Refutation queue honesty**: the wrapper *flags* citation problems, it doesn't pre-clear them — the skill now says so, and the architect refutes cited findings first, taking `UNCITED` items last as cheap skims. (A hard prefilter that drops uncited findings was rejected: it would violate the reviewers' no-silent-drop rule.)
- **`grok-researcher` on the supervisor**: new `grok-research` lane alias (read-only, 600s default); long scans with a raised `TIMEOUT:` no longer die at the harness's 10-minute foreground wall. `run-lane.sh` now defaults the budget by lane type (600s review/research, 1800s implement).
- **Declared spikes**: a named verification-only tier for caller-declared throwaway/prototype work — declared, never inferred, restated in the report. An honest escape valve beats silent self-downgrade under pressure.
- **Smoke test asserts permissions**: the fake CLIs record argv; tests now lock `workspace-write` for codex implement, `read-only` for codex-review, and no `acceptEdits` for grok-research (five tests, all green).
- Copy fixes: grok-reviewer's body rationale now matches the vs-implementer invariant (was vs-architect); the flowchart's verify node reflects conditional verification; "runs twice" and "one authoritative run" reconciled (producer dev loop + wrapper acceptance when the log is inconclusive); Requirements state the degraded one-CLI bill (grok types, Opus reviews, on Anthropic quota); Parallelism adds worktree isolation with serial merges for heavy fan-out.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-11

Partly adopted from a third external Grok 4.5 review.

- **Review fallback chain** (the review pipeline previously had none): when the opposite-family CLI reviewer is unavailable, the cold pass falls back to the strongest Claude model available (Opus subagent, diff-only and cold — Claude is a third family versus both CLI implementers), announced. Review is never silently skipped and never silently same-family. Requirements now say full assurance wants both CLIs: your implementer's opposite family is your reviewer.
- **Reviewers moved onto the supervisor**: `run-lane.sh` gains read-only `codex-review` / `grok-review` lane types, and both reviewer agents launch detached — a `TIMEOUT:` override above ~600s previously died at the harness's 10-minute foreground wall, the same bug class fixed for implementers in 3.4.0. Smoke test extended to cover the review lane path.
- **Verification copy contradiction fixed**: the implementers' Rules and `VERIFIED:` field still demanded an unconditional re-run, undercutting 1.1.0's conditional verification — wrappers would burn the suite twice. Copy now consistently accepts captured-log evidence. (The reviewer's suggested "machine-checkable footer" was rejected: footers land in the model-authored final message and are claims, not evidence; the machine-captured log is the evidence.)
- **Refutation bounds**: refute in severity order; after two respec → re-implement → re-review rounds on one diff, surface residual findings to the user instead of thrashing.
- **Citation coordinates**: reviewers cite post-image (new-file) `file:line` so findings map to the working tree the refutation pass reads.
- **Research verification teeth**: the verifying lane must fetch and read the sources themselves, never judge from the researcher's summaries.
- **Must-do checklist** at the top of the skill — six obligations, an index against under-pressure skipping.
- Copy fixes: doctor banner no longer claims a same-named upstream (stale since the rename); a missing CLI is now a doctor *warning* with the degradation spelled out (auth-broken stays a failure); `grok-implementer` names codex-reviewer as the usual cold lens; "route every lane by verifiability" softened to the supporting lanes it actually governs.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-10

- **Verifiability routing stated as the general principle**: every lane routes by how its output can fail, not by task label — invisible-omission failure modes get the strongest model. (The exploration split shipped in 1.2.0 was one instance; now the rule itself is doctrine.)
- **Research verification lane**: grok-researcher's leads are breadth, not truth — verification-grade synthesis (source-reading, adversarial fact-checking, confirmed-vs-anecdotal labeling) goes to the strongest Claude model before anything load-bearing rests on them. Completes the research pipeline the way 1.2.0's refutation pass completed review.
- Context-lean rules gain the spec-writing heuristic (read the ~40 lines around the seams, never the ~1,000-line file) and filter-at-the-tool-call discipline (`--jq`, `grep`, `tail`).

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-10

Doctrine promoted into the skill from the maintainer's private CLAUDE.md, where it was covering gaps the plugin should own.

- **Refutation pass** defined in the review tiers — both reviewer agents already said "the caller runs the refutation pass," but the skill never defined it. The architect now refutes each cited finding against the code before acting (confirmed → corrected spec; refuted → dropped with a reason), and on security-tier diffs also refutes the *clean* report by spot-checking the riskiest branch.
- **Exploration routed by failure mode**: bounded, checkable lookups → cheap read-only agent; completeness-critical sweeps ("what else can touch this resource?") → the strongest Claude model available, because an omitted answer never appears in the report. Load-bearing exploration claims get a session-level spot-check before architecture rests on them.
- **Parallelism**: past ~4 parallel lanes, propose the harness's Workflow tool (where available; explicit user opt-in) so lane transcripts never enter the architect's context.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Partly adopted from a second external Grok 4.5 review; the reviewer-family rule came from the maintainer.

- **`codex-reviewer` agent + cross-family review rule**: the cold reviewer must come from a different model family than the implementer — under the grok default, grok-reviewer reviewing grok's diffs was the same family grading its own homework. Grok implemented → `codex-reviewer` (GPT-5.6 Sol, `--sandbox read-only`); codex or a Claude fallback implemented → `grok-reviewer`. Skill review tiers, lanes tables, flowchart, and agent descriptions updated.
- **`run-lane.sh` process-group hardening**: `set -m` puts each lane in its own process group and every kill targets the group (`kill -- -PID`) — killing only the parent left CLI child workers as orphans still writing to the tree. The watchdog now polls and self-terminates when the lane exits naturally, closing a recycled-PID group-kill hazard the old full-budget sleep carried.
- **`scripts/test-run-lane.sh`**: no-API smoke test (PATH-shimmed fake CLI) asserting group-kill on reap, natural-exit detection with watchdog self-termination, and budget kill with logging.
- `fable-advisor` agent now enforces the evidence rule itself: it declines to rule when the decisive evidence wasn't provided, instead of guessing.
- Trivial-edit bright line in the skill: if it needs a verification command to trust, it isn't trivial.
- Honesty fixes: FAQ no longer claims every diff gets cross-vendor review "for free" (verification is automatic; cold review is the explicit tier step); intro says assurance comes from verification plus tiered review; flowchart shows the mirrored codex-mode fallback and the reviewer-family branch.
- **Conditional wrapper verification** — one authoritative run per task, not a blind re-run: the wrapper accepts the CLI's machine-captured log when it shows the verification command passing as the run's final act (with no edits after), and re-runs only otherwise. Grok lanes usually still re-run (acceptEdits blocks commands); codex lanes, which run tests in their dev loop, usually don't need to. Spec contract now asks for the smallest verification bundle that proves the change.
- README reworked wholesale for readability: consolidated rules section, deduplicated mode/fallback prose, permissions table covers all producer roles.
- Marketplace/plugin descriptions updated (modes, both reviewers).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-10

- README: the "always-on" recommendation now matches the plugin's design — a two-line CLAUDE.md (standing skill trigger + mode declaration) instead of the inherited doctrine-restatement paragraph, which duplicated skill content and omitted invoking the skill.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-10

- Renamed plugin and repo: fable-advisor → **fable-orchestrator** (`mar3co/fable-orchestrator`), with the version reset to 1.0.0 as an independent plugin. Includes everything listed under 3.5.0 below. Breaking relative to the fable-advisor releases: the install key is `fable-orchestrator@fable-orchestrator`, agent references become `fable-orchestrator:*`, and the canonical config prefix becomes `fable-orchestrator: implementation lane = …` (old `fable-advisor:` declarations are still honored by intent). The advisor agent keeps its `fable-advisor` name. The rename ends the install-time name collision with the original plugin.

## 3.5.0 — 2026-07-10

Adopted, with modifications, from an external Grok 4.5 review of the fork.

- **Implementation routing modes**: `fable-advisor: implementation lane = grok | codex | mix` (one CLAUDE.md line; grok when unconfigured). Fixed modes send everything to one lane; mix lets the architect route per task — mechanical/spec-determined → grok, correctness-critical → codex, doubt → codex. Availability is discovered, not declared: every mode falls back through the other installed CLI lane to a guaranteed Claude Opus subagent, announced.
- **`scripts/run-lane.sh`**: process supervisor owning launch, pure-bash watchdog (no coreutils dependency), bounded wait slices, and cleanup — implementer agents are now thin wrappers, and the fragile shell moved out of prompts.
- **Review tiers** in the orchestration skill: verification ≠ cold review; mechanical diffs → verification only, behavior-bearing → cold `grok-reviewer` pass, security/auth/concurrency/migrations → add a silent-failure completeness read on a strong Claude model.
- **`grok-researcher` narrowed to live web/X research** — codebase lookups (where-is-X, inventories) belong to cheap in-process read-only agents, which are faster and more accurate for file:line work than an external CLI hop.
- **Honesty pass** on README + skill: "near-parity" softened to "good enough when the architect owns the hard parts and verifies"; verification vs cold review distinguished; the three-layer cost structure (architect / Sonnet wrapper / CLI producer) stated; "cheapest adequate lane" prose reconciled with the mode doctrine.
- Advisor consults must include pasted decisive evidence (failing output, traces), not just file paths.
- Parallelism rule: one writer per module/package; schema and migration work is always serial.
- README: producer permissions table. Doctor: prints fork identity + version banner.
- Grok is the unconfigured default implementation lane (flipped from codex before release; fallback chain grok → codex → Opus).
- The skill absorbs the last externally-held doctrine: trivial edits (few-line fixes, renames, doc tweaks) stay with the architect inline, and the session drives the grok CLI directly only for short single-answer web lookups. A user's CLAUDE.md needs only two lines: a standing trigger for this skill, plus the lane declaration.

## 3.4.1 — 2026-07-10

- README: Mermaid flowchart ("How routing works") showing lane selection, the configurable default, the announced fallback chain, and the verification gate.

## 3.4.0 — 2026-07-10

- Implementer lanes launch their CLI **detached** and supervise it in bounded wait slices, fixing the 10-minute lane shutdown on long runs: the harness caps any foreground tool call at 10 minutes, which killed the lane's supervision mid-run while the CLI kept working as an orphan. The timeout now wraps the detached process itself, so the wall clock holds even if the lane dies.
- Implementation-lane default wall clock raised 600 → 1800 seconds (long codex runs at high reasoning routinely exceed ten minutes); research/review lanes stay at 600, foreground.
- Orchestration skill: every spec must estimate its wall clock honestly and carry a `TIMEOUT: <seconds>` line when it differs meaningfully from the default — undersized budgets kill legitimate runs, oversized ones delay hang detection.

## 3.3.0 — 2026-07-10

- `scripts/doctor.sh`: one-command lane preflight — timeout binary, both CLIs (presence, auth, model access via a tiny live call per lane), and a reminder that Claude model pins degrade silently.
- Caller-tunable timeouts: a spec may carry a `TIMEOUT: <seconds>` line to raise a lane's 600-second default wall clock; all four CLI agents honor it.
- `grok-reviewer`: diff-size guard — diffs over ~1,500 lines are reviewed in per-file batches, with an `UNCOVERED` report field and a `partial` status instead of silent quality collapse.
- Grok agents capture output via `mktemp` instead of predictable `/tmp/*-$$.txt` paths, matching the codex lane and the plugin's own "never a fixed path" rule.
- Orchestration skill: advisor consults must include the exact file paths to read; spec contract documents the optional `TIMEOUT:` line.
- Plugin and marketplace descriptions mention `grok-researcher` / `grok-reviewer`.

## 3.2.1 — 2026-07-10

- README rewritten to describe the fork natively: five-lane table, configurable default lane, no-racing rationale, guaranteed Opus terminal fallback. Provenance reduced to a one-line note; upstream differences moved to the FAQ.

## 3.2.0 — 2026-07-10

- Default implementation lane is user-configurable: one CLAUDE.md line (`fable-advisor: default implementation lane = grok`) flips the default from codex to grok; intent honored over exact syntax. The other CLI lane is the first fallback; a Claude Opus subagent is always the terminal fallback. Agent descriptions state the conditional default (they are visible at routing time even when the skill body is not loaded).
- Added a `mar3co` copyright line to the LICENSE for fork modifications.

## 3.1.1 — 2026-07-10

Fork baseline, diverging from upstream 3.1.0:

- `codex-implementer` (GPT-5.6 Sol, high reasoning) becomes the default implementation lane; `grok-implementer` becomes the codex-outage fallback. Lane racing removed — assurance comes from cross-vendor review of the diff, not duplicate implementations.
- Fixed, announced fallback chain: default lane → other CLI lane → Claude Opus subagent.
- New agents: `grok-researcher` (breadth-first live-web/X research and mechanical codebase lookups, distilled and cited) and `grok-reviewer` (cold diff-only second review lens, every claim cited `file:line`).
- Removed upstream author's newsletter promotion; metadata points at the fork.
